# Hogwarts "Level Builder" 

This website allows users to design their own "Hogwarts-Style" graphics. This is meant for people who are intending to develop 2D RPG style video games, as it allows users to pick from a vast amount of sprites to design and visualize potential "levels" and in-game locations.
